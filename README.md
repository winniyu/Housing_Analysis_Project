# README: Housing Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of houses in Ames, Iowa, using a dataset containing 40 potential predictors. The goal is to build and refine regression models to accurately estimate house prices based on features such as lot size, house quality, year built, and more. The analysis is divided into three main parts:

1. **Basic Model Development**
2. **Residual Analysis and Model Refinement**
3. **Fancier Model with Transformations**
4. **Final Model and Prediction**

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `AmesTrain.csv`. The dataset contains information on forty potential predictors and the selling price (in $1,000’s) for a sample of homes. A separate file identifies the variables in the Ames Housing data and explains some of the coding.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following parts:

### Part 1: Build an Initial “Basic” Model
- Use quantitative variables to build an initial model.
- Do not use categorical variables, transformations, or interactions at this stage.
- Use at least two model selection methods (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination).
- Include the `summary()` output for your model, comments on significant predictors, and VIF values.

### Part 2: Residual Analysis for Your Basic Model
- Perform residual analysis to check model conditions.
- Identify and handle unusual data points.
- Refit the model if necessary and document changes.

### Part 3: Find a “Fancier Model”
- Incorporate transformations of predictors and response variables.
- Use multiple model selection methods to determine the best model with transformed variables.
- Discuss the process used to transform predictors and/or response.

### Part 4: Residual Analysis for Your Fancier Model
- Repeat the residual analysis on the new model constructed in Part 3.
- Discuss the process and findings.

### Part 5: Final Model
- Use the refined model to predict the price of a specific house with given characteristics.
- Construct a 95% confidence interval for the predicted price.

## Key Insights
- The final model achieved an adjusted R² of **0.8806**, indicating strong predictive power.
- Transformations like log(Price) and squared terms improved model fit and addressed non-linearity.
- The 95% confidence interval for the predicted price of a sample house was **[175.97, 353.36] thousand dollars**.

## Code
The R code for this project is included in the repository. Key libraries used include:
- `readr`
- `car`
- `tidyr`
- `dplyr`
- `leaps`
- `corrplot`

## Usage
To run the code, ensure you have the necessary R libraries installed. You can install them using the following commands:
```R
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("car")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("dplyr")
